C - Hello, World

The project is an assignment for introduction to C.
we will see:
	how to use scripts to run files.
	how to write c in C89 coding style.
	how to complie c files through the four stage is compilation
	and some somevanced assignments
	
Th C functions invloves are:
	main.c : a dummy file to test certain scripts and how the stages of compliation perform
	cisfun.c : a file create through 3-name script
	4-puts.c : A c program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle as is by using the puts function
	5-printf.c: prints with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, using the printf function
	6-size.c: a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
	101-quote.c:  C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.This is done by  a write function rather than printf or pusts function.

***scripts used***
	0-preprocessor : runs a C file  stored in CFILE variable through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
	1-compiler: a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
	2-assembler: a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
	3-name : Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
	100-intel: a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
